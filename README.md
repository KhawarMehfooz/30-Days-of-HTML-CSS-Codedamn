# 30 Days HTML/CSS Challenge

This is a Github repository created for the 30 Days HTML/CSS Challenge offered by the codedamn website. The challenge is designed to help developers improve their HTML/CSS skills by providing daily exercises and projects to work on for a period of 30 days.

Each day of the challenge consists of a new project with instructions and requirements to complete it. This repository contains my solutions to each project and serves as a record of my progress throughout the challenge.
